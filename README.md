# Railway-Reservation-System
Created the portal for both Admin and user (passenger). Admin has the option to create a detailed database of the passengers for reservation, add/view and manage their details. 
Users get an option to reserve a seat in a particular train based on their concession category & availability of seats.
Users gets the option to enquire about particular detail regarding a train
and cancel their reservation (this also takes care of the refund amount theyâ€™d be receiving based on the time period)
Operations are manipulated using basic OOPs in C++ by categorising every next step in a different class and maintaining its functions using the objects and its corresponding methods in their respective classes.
